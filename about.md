HAAIII My name is Tim Vienckowski. I'm a human-centered designer and strategist. To me, there is no better job than to distill complex ideas and processes into clear, engaging, and unexpected visualizations that empower people to think on a systems level. I am also easily excited by fonts. (This one is Moderat, by TIGHTYPE.) Currently, I'm working as a Human Innovation Fellow (!) and visual designer for [The Lab at OPM](https://lab.opm.gov), a human-centered design practice within the federal government. I live in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with [Amos](https://amosthethird.com) and [Lela](https://instagram.com/timmypilgrims). The aura reader who took the above picture told me I am happy and care for others, but I don't get enough sleep.

Send me an [email](mailto:tim.vienckowski@gmail.com)! I would love to hear from you.
