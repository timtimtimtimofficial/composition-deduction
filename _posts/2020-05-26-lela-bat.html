The resulting Cross-Government Journey Map was based on data from interviews with 25 veterans and service members and experts from six federal agencies. The map lays out the process chronologically, and qualitatively in terms of “building blocks” and “barriers.” The team made recommendations for future improvements to the customer experience based on themes that emerged when synthesizing their research.

The research for the original journey map accumulated a trove of powerful data and insights. I was part of a team (with Maura Newell, Mina Jafarpoor, and Aaron Stienstra) that set out to build on that research and find ways to deepen its impact. In particular, we wanted to take a closer look at the process through the lens of human needs and emotions. Our aim was to build a tool that could help government employees, faced with improving the experience of people moving through this process, find solidarity with their customers.
